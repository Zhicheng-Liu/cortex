v1.0.5.3
Version associated with the first Cortex publication,
"De novo assembly and genotyping of variants using 
colored de Bruijn graphs", 
Z. Iqbal, M. Caccamo, I. Turner, P. Flicek, G. McVean
(Nature Genetics).


=== NEWS ====

The most notable thing about this release is that it is enormous (in size).
This is because for this release only, I am bundling the entire
GNU Scientific Library with Cortex, because I have a dependency on it,
and I haven't figured out how to either
a) package an rpm so it triggers your system to automatically pull down the GSL
b) just cut out the single GSL file that I actually need

Apologies that this Cortex zip is so big, will sort this out in future releases

New features:

--remove_low_coverage_supernodes
The error cleaning method described in our paper, gives better
sensitivity than a simple coverage cutoff for kmers.

-- Genotype calling with likelihoods
If you specify the type of experiment (each colour is
a diploid sample, or each colour is haploid), and
also specify the genome length, Cortex will make genotype 
calls and give a genotype confidence (difference between
maximum log likelihood and next one).

-- Allows user to enter estimated sequencing error rate

--exclude_ref_bubbles
New option which allows you to explicitly say you want to
remove bubbles found in the reference; previously this was inferred
to be true if you specified the reference colour with --ref_colour,
but now there are situations when you might want to specify the reference
colour without excluding ref-bubbles. See manual for details.

--dumping of aligned subgraph
Previous versions already supported aligning fasta/q to a graph and printing our coverage
in the different colours. This version also allows the user to choose to dumpa new binary graph,
just of the subgraph which is touched by the alignment process. Suppose you have a particular
pair of alleles of interest, or gene, and you have a big whole-genome graph which is sometimes
cumbersome. All you need to do is make a fasta of the regions you are interested in, and align it,
and Cortex can dump the subgraph just of the region touched by the alignment.
Future releases will allow you to dump "the region around" the aligned bit also.

--genotype_site - This is beta code, used for the proof of concept
genotyping of HLA-B in our paper. The syntax is ugly, and both the UI and 
implementation may change in future releases.


Bug Fixes:
Various minor bug fixes.

Outstanding bugs:
 - Still have not sorted out compilation on the Intel compiler.

New dependency:
cortex_var now has a dependency on the GNU Scientific Library.
If you try to compile and get an error like
 "gsl-1.15/gsl/gsl_sf_gamma.h:25: fatal error: gsl/gsl_sf_result.h: No such file or directory"
then ask your sysadmin to install:

gsl-bin
libgsl0ldbl
libgsl0-dev



Thanks to:
Isaac Turner for very many bug reports and usability suggestions.
Alex Dilthey for a neat Makefile change
Ian Streeter for pointing out a bug I thought I had fixed (now really fixed)




+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
v1.0.5.2

Internal release - only ever seen by Beta testers



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
v1.0.5.1
Bugfix - fixed a corner-case  where binary files dumped
after loading paired-end fastq (using --pe_list) were 
missing some nodes. Could manifest after loading 
binaries and trying to traverse the graph. 

Recommend users upgrade to this version.

Test results:
All unit tests pass, with valgrind also.
See latest_test_results for details.

Open issues:
 - does not compile for Intel compiler on IA64.
