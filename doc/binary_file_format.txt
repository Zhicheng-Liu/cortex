Binary File Format Version 6:

Header: 6 chars (the word "CORTEX")
        1 int (version number)
        1 int (kmer size)
        1 int (number of uint64_t encoding the kmer)
        1 int (number of colours = num_cols)
        num_cols ints (mean read length for each colour)
        num_cols long longs (total sequence loaded into each colour)
	
	for (i=0 to num_cols-1)
	  1 int (length L of name/sample-id of i-th colour)	
          L chars (sample id for colour i)

	for (i=0 to num_cols-1)
          1 long double - estimated sequencing error rate for colour i

	for (i=0 to num_cols-1) ## error cleaning info for each colour
	  1 boolean -was there top clipping
	  1 boolean -was --remove_low_coverage_supernodes used
	  1 boolean -was --remove_low_coverage_kmers used
	  1 boolean - was this colour cleaned against another graph
	  1 int - threshold for --remove_low_coverage_supernodes
	  1 int - threshold for --remove_low_coverage_kmer
	  1 int length L  of name of graph against which this colour was cleaned
	  L chars - name of graph against which this colour was cleaned

        6 chars (the word "CORTEX")

Followed by consecutive nodes. Each node consists of:
        1 BinaryKmer (defined in include/basic/binary_kmer.h
        1 int (coverage)
        1 char (typedefed to Edges)




*******************************
Binary File Format Version 5:
Identical for v4, except coverage is written as uint32_t.
